Thus, our next step is to run *dimensionality reduction*. In particular, we will run *SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)*, which is a kind of generalized *PCA (Principal Components Analysis)* to select the top $k$ principal components. Here's a visualization of dimensionality reduction with SVD. In this picture our co-occurrence matrix is $A$ with $n$ rows corresponding to $n$ words. We obtain a full matrix decomposition, with the singular values ordered in the diagonal $S$ matrix, and our new, shorter length-$k$ word vectors in $U_k$.\n","\n","![Picture of an SVD](./imgs/svd.png \"SVD\")\n","\n","This reduced-dimensionality co-occurrence representation preserves semantic relationships between words, e.g. *doctor* and *hospital* will be closer than *doctor* and *dog*.\n","\n","**Notes:** If you can barely remember what an eigenvalue is, here's [a slow, friendly introduction to SVD](https://davetang.org/file/Singular_Value_Decomposition_Tutorial.pdf). If you want to learn more thoroughly about PCA or SVD, feel free to check out lectures [7](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l7.pdf), [8](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/s15/l/l8.pdf), and [9](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l9.pdf) of CS168. These course notes provide a great high-level treatment of these general purpose algorithms. Though, for the purpose of this class, you only need to know how to extract the k-dimensional embeddings by utilizing pre-programmed implementations of these algorithms from the numpy, scipy, or sklearn python packages. In practice, it is challenging to apply full SVD to large corpora because of the memory needed to perform PCA or SVD. However, if you only want the top $k$ vector components for relatively small $k$ — known as [Truncated SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Truncated_SVD) — then there are reasonably scalable techniques to compute those iteratively."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7IKeK4xtSStv"},"source":["### Plotting Co-Occurrence Word Embeddings\n","\n","Here, we will be using the Reuters (business and financial news) corpus.

For example, \"leaves\" has both \"go_away\" and \"a_structure_of_a_plant\" meaning in the top 10, and \"scoop\" has both \"handed_waffle_cone\" and \"lowdown\". You will probably need to try several polysemous or homonymic words before you find one.\n","\n","Please state the word you discover and the multiple meanings that occur in the top 10.
